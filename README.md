# OpenGL
The code from my learning openGL. Initially from a tutorial on the freecodecamp youtube channel, but later I overwrite some stuff and did it by following the tutorial for breakout at opengl.com.

Sadly got overwhelmed by coursework around the time I was working on this, but got as far as implementing somewhat-working SAT, though I don't think it's meant for concave or extremely thin shapes, like I was using for testing :p.

Also, had an issue where the coordinates of points where flipped from their real position, hence why the mesh doesn't line up with the collider.

Furthermore, Visual Studio 2022 seems to have completely cooked the formatting, and apparently I just had a lot of external dependencies because I couldn't get cmake working.

This is literally just here to prove I have touched openGL before I would **not** recommend trying to dig through any of the files, and I hope I didn't leave any questionably named test variables or debug statements in.
