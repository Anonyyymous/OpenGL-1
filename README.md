# OpenGL
The code from my learning openGL. Initially from a tutorial on the freecodecamp youtube channel, but later I overwrite some stuff and did it by following the tutorial for breakout at opengl.com.

Sadly got overwhelmed by coursework around the time I was working on this, but got as far as implementing somewhat-working SAT, though I don't think it's meant for concave or extremely thin shapes, like I was using for testing :p.

Also, had an issue where the coordinates of points where flipped from their real position, hence why the mesh doesn't line up with the collider.
